# Java_Based_Ray_Tracer

 A ray tracer written from scratch using Java. The code supports hierarchy and Instances. I implemented

    * Ray generation
    * Sphere class, ray-sphere intersection, and UV Mapping for spheres
    * Blinn-Phong shading
    * Shadows and multiple light sources
    * Plane with checkerboard pattern, and ray-plane intersection
    * Bounding boxes and ray-box intersection
    * Ray tracing triangular meshes, ray-triangle intersection and acceleration structure (with a single b-box)
    * Anti-aliasing with stochastic super sampling, and jittering.
    * Parallelization
